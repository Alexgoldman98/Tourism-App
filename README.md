# Tourism App

## The purpose:

The purpose of this project is to build a web application that allows travellers to search for cities around the world and find useful information so they plan their trips accordingly.

## Features:

This application has the following features:

1. User can search for a city by entering the city's name or by clicking on any of the three most destinations in the home page
2. The application displays all cities with similar names from different countries
3. The application also displays a list of recommended place for travellers who have not decided their destination
4. For each searched city, the application shows the date, current weather, 4-days weather forecast, local currency of the searched city against Canadian Dollar, popular destination, and google map
5. The application provides a feature for users to save their favourite cities/ destinations in local storage so they can access it quickly later by clicking on favourites button
